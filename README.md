**Gameplay**
```
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
You are X/O, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O/X. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
The first player to get 3 of his/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie/draw.
```
